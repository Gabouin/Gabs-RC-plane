# Gabs-RC-plane
I'm making an RC plane with styrofoam and some parts will be 3d printed. I will use servo motors, batteries, a transmitter , a receiver, a brushless motor, a propeller, a motor controller and a lot of wires and connectors ! more informations on BLUEPRINT !

I want to make this project because I love planes and electronics. I also want to work as a plane engineer.

Here are the plans I made on Canva and convert as a PDF for the structure of the plane: https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjMwMjgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--e8056efed682603be2c0ef0acb6476836d1cb8ba/SPIT%20G%2001%20(1).pdf

3D model of the plane that you can check on the step file (only to visualize) :
